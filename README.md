## Conclusion
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive visualization of employee attrition across multiple dimensions such as age, salary, gender, education, job role, and tenure. Key findings indicate that the highest attrition rates are observed among employees with lower salaries, shorter tenures (particularly under 2 years), and within specific job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.

The dashboard empowers HR professionals and business leaders to:

Identify critical attrition patterns.

Pinpoint vulnerable employee segments.

Make data-driven decisions to enhance employee retention strategies.

By leveraging Power BI, this project demonstrates the power of business intelligence tools in simplifying complex HR data, improving strategic workforce planning, and ultimately reducing employee turnover through targeted interventions.
